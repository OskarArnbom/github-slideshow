                <p>Who keyed your car in the cover of darkness
                   leaving marks on the inside
                   unprotected by the moats
                   you built inside your mind</p>

                <p>Who’s to blame now that you find your ears have been tuned
                    to the radio static and grainy interference
                    you didn’t use to hear
                    it whirls through the night
                    softly crepitating at first, but
                    rising like the scaffolding at the construction sites
                    into a vortex of desire and dread
                    it roars in your head
                    as your awareness flickers in and out</p>

            <div class="column3">
                <p>Who can you ask about the shape that’s emerging
                    there in the centre of your vision
                    which slithers up the walls and through your last 
                    remaining defences
                    blurring what you hoped was a way back
                    in endless shades of red and black
                    </p>

                    <p1>On-DemanD Culture</p1>
                    <p>is a Stockholm based post punk band. Some of our influences are Joy Division and The Smiths. On-Demand Culture was formed in 2017 and consists of lead vocalists on the guitar, Max Ström and Arvid Häggqvist. One bass player, William Taylor, and a drummer, Oskar Arnbom. Max and Arvid are childhood friends and started making music together at a young age. They later wanted to start their own band and began looking for other components for their projects. They found William through a band finder app and picked up Oskar later on, after hearing about him through a mutual friend.</p>
